# Chrome extension trello-custom-fields-first
Chrome Extension that pushes the custom fields above the description in card view

Since the last design update from Trello, the custom fields power up section is below the description.
If your description is a bit longer, you won't see your custom fields without scrolling.

If your custom fields are more important than your description (like for me), than this is the extension you need.
